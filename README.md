## samekeyletters

Inspired by [this xkcd what-if](https://what-if.xkcd.com/75/).

It finds out which words, in 15 different languages, demand the maximum amount of consecutive keypresses when typed in an [old phone keypad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_keypad#Layout_and_characters).

Try it.

I discovered all those languages tie at 6 keypresses.
Except **English** and **Finnish**, with 7. 

Finnish words were always at key 8, by the way:
kouriintuntuvuutta, muututtua, puututtu, suututtu, ulottuvuuteen, uutuutta, uutuuttaan
